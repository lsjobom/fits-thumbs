# fits-thumbs
For remembering how to make thumbnail images from .fits files

## ds9thumb.sh
This is mainly to remember how to call [ds9](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html) with the appropriate parameters to get a 3x3 arcsec image. The script assumes that it is called as `./ds9thumb.sh thumbname RA DEC` with thumbname being the name of the output file, RA and DEC in degrees, fk5. File is output as png.

Further command line options is available at <http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/command.html>.
